I definitely believe that modern technology brings people closer. Before, if your best friend moved to another country, you might lose touch completely. Now, you can video chat with them every day and feel like you're in the same room. It also helps people find communities they wouldn't have access to otherwise, like online groups for rare hobbies or support groups for people with specific health conditions. It has opened up a whole new world of social connection that was impossible before.
